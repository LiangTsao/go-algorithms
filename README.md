# Go Algorithms

This repository contains some of my first steps working with Go and implementing basic, advanced and graph algoristhms. I hope to increase the list during the next months so keep in touch.

## Basic Algorithms

### Sorting
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Bubble sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Heap sort
- Memoization for Fibonacci

### Searching
- Binary Search

### Graph Algoristhms
- Depth first search
- Dijkstra's algorithm

### Advanced Algoristhms
- Hanoi's towers problem
- Sudoku problem
